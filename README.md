What Are MCP Servers? 
MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers act like a bridge between your AI model or your CLI and the tools you want it to use. 
They give your model controlled access to things like: 
● Files 
● APIs 
● Local functions 
● External systems like Github, Firebase etc 
In simple terms: 
An MCP server gives Gemini CLI “tools” so it can actually do things instead of just replying with text.
